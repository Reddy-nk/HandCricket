Toss : same as head or tail here we have odd or even and the one who wins toss will choose to bat or bowl
OUT : if bowlers bowls same number as batsmen then the batsmen is out . else batsmen gets as many runs as he put with his fingers.
In this game there is onyl a single wicket. If you are out once then you can't bat anymore and then you have to bowl.
Rest of rules are same as normal cricket
This is a single player game and the opponent is the computer.
All the best, hit as many as u can :)
